Choose an executor that can run Lua scripts:

- **KRNL** (Free, stable, good support)

---

### 🧾 Step 2: Open The Strongest Battlegrounds

Launch the game from Roblox and wait for full load before injection.

---

### 📜 Step 3: Load Your Script

Here’s a basic example of a universal GUI loader:

```

Paste this into your executor and press "Inject" or "Execute." A GUI should appear with toggles and settings.

## 📦 Sample Script Snippet (Educational Use Only)

A basic Auto Punch script might look like this:

```lua
while wait(0.1) do
   local target = game:GetService("Players"):FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Player")
   if target and target ~= game.Players.LocalPlayer then
      game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Remotes.Punch:FireServer(target.Character.Humanoid)
   end
end
```

This will simulate automatic punching of nearby players. Always test on alt accounts and never use in public servers unless you're willing to risk detection.
